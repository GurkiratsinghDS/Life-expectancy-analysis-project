# Life-expectancy-analysis-project

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Life Expectancy** data to understand the key factors that influence how long people live across different countries and years. Using Python and data science techniques, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature understanding, and insights generation.

The goal is to:

* Explore global life expectancy trends
* Identify important socio-economic and health-related factors
* Practice real-world data analysis using Python

This project is suitable for **Data Analyst / Data Science portfolio** demonstration.

##  Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** Life Expectancy Data
* **Format:** CSV
* **Rows:** Multiple country-year observations
* **Key Features Include:**

  * Country
  * Year
  * Life expectancy
  * Adult Mortality
  * GDP
  * Schooling
  * Alcohol consumption
  * BMI
  * Health expenditure

 *The dataset contains missing values and real-world inconsistencies, making it ideal for practical data analysis.*

##  Tools & Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:**

  * pandas – data manipulation
  * numpy – numerical operations
  * matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization
  * scikit-learn – preprocessing and analysis

## Project Workflow

### 1️ Data Loading

* Imported the dataset using pandas
* Inspected shape, columns, and data types

### 2️ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed or corrected inconsistent data
* Converted data types where necessary

### 3️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed life expectancy trends over years
* Compared developed vs developing countries
* Studied correlations between life expectancy and key factors
* Visualized distributions and relationships using plots

### 4️ Insights & Observations

* Higher **schooling and GDP** are strongly associated with higher life expectancy
* **Adult mortality** shows a strong negative correlation
* Developed countries generally have higher and more stable life expectancy trends

---

##  Key Visualizations

* Life expectancy trends over time
* Correlation heatmaps
* Distribution plots of major variables
* Country-wise comparisons

---


##  Future Improvements

* Build a machine learning model to predict life expectancy
* Perform feature importance analysis
* Add interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
* Apply advanced statistical analysis
